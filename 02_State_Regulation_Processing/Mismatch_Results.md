|contaminant|
|---|
|2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin| - ug/L to pg/L
|bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate| - some is correct, the other is in ug/L to mg/Kg aka mg/L
|Dissolved Aluminum| - both in ug/L and mg/L
|Dissolved Antimony| - both in ug/l and mg/L
|Dissolved Arsenic| - both in ug/l and mg/L
|Dissolved Barium| - both in ug/l and mg/L
|Dissolved Beryllium| - both in ug/l and mg/L
|Dissolved Cadmium| - both in ug/l and mg/L
|Dissolved Copper| - both in ug/l and mg/L
|Dissolved Lead| - both in ug/l and mg/L
|Dissolved Mercury| - ng/L, ug/L, and mg/L
|Dissolved Nickel| - both in ug/l and mg/L
|Dissolved Nitrate| - 10 as N mg/L  to mg/L as N,  there is also 10 as N mg/L to mg/L
|Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite| - 10 as N mg/L to mg/L as N
|Dissolved Nitrite| - 1 as N mg/L to mg/L as N ----- these are actually the same, and they need to be adjusted in the db
|Dissolved Selenium| - both in ug/l and mg/L
|Dissolved Strontium| - pCi/L to ug/L, and pCi/L to mg/L
|Dissolved Thallium| - both in ug/l and mg/L
|Dissolved Uranium| - the units of measure are in mg/L as N, which makes no sense 
|Total Chromium| - both in ug/l and mg/L
